# Privacy Policy
v1.0: April 28th, 2022

This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect
it, and what we do with it. We’re Podcast Index, LLC.

## Information we collect

### Our websites, at *.podcastindex.org and podcasterwallet.com

To browse our website, we do not require cookies or any personal information.

We collect limited, non-personal information from users as they browse our website to
ensure proper function and protect against abuse.

Like any website, that information is automatically collected in server logs. This
includes:
  * IP addresses
  * Browser/app type, browser/app language, the date and time of the request, the query
    parameters of the request and any geolocation data that comes through CloudFlare, our
    caching host.

Server logs are held in cloud systems in different locations across the world. We
automatically delete server logs after 90 days.

If you use a podcast app which makes direct connections with the Podcast Index API, we
collect the above information too.

We cache elements of our website using CloudFlare.
[CloudFlare’s privacy policy is here](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/privacypolicy/).

* The Podcast Index links to podcast RSS feeds, which may enclose email addresses and
  other personal information. These are published by the podcasters directly, normally
  through their podcast host. We do not process or retain email addresses from RSS feeds.

### For developers: the Podcast Index API at api.podcastindex.org

In addition to the above, we collect information from developers with their informed
consent as they use our API.

This information includes:
* The email address that was used to create the developer account and issue API tokens.
* A hashed, non-reversible password for the developer’s account.
* Details of how the developer’s API token was used in our service, such as search
  queries or device user-agents.

Upon logging in, we use cookies to identify you to us.

This information is held in servers located in the US.

## PodcasterWallet, at podcasterwallet.com

In addition to our normal website collection, above, we collect information from users
that sign up for an account on podcasterwallet.com. This information includes:

* The email address that was used to create the account and any cryptocurrency wallet
  addresses and names that are entered into the account by the user.
* We collect the user-agent string and IP address at the time of the account creation and
  update it on subsequent logins in order to detect unusual or fraudulent account
  behavior.
* We also use a third party CAPTCHA service (hCaptcha) to protect our services from
  malicious or fraudulent account creation.
  [This is their privacy policy](https://www.hcaptcha.com/privacy).

## What we don’t use and/or collect

We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information beyond the email
address that is used to sign up for an account.

We do not use third-party cookies or third-party page analytics beyond CloudFlare’s
native analytics as part of caching.

## How we use information we collect

We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect
and improve them.

## Will we share information we collect?

  public and will be returned to podcast apps in Podcast Index API requests.

  enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, information we collect
  could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. If this type of
  event happens, all users with an account will be notified and given at least 90 days
  notice in case they choose to have their accounts deleted.
