       related software, except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable
       law.
    7. Use the APIs for any activities where the use or failure of the APIs could lead to death,
       personal injury, or environmental damage (such as the operation of nuclear facilities, air traffic
       control, or life support systems).

       Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of State.

       and identify your API Client. You will keep your credentials confidential and make
       reasonable efforts to prevent and discourage other API Clients from using your
       credentials. Developer credentials may not be embedded in open source projects.
    2. Our communications to you and our APIs may contain Podcast Index confidential
       information. Podcast Index confidential information includes any materials,
       communications, and information that are marked confidential or that would normally be considered
       confidential under the circumstances. If you receive any such information, then you will not
       disclose it to any third-party without Podcast Index's prior written consent. Podcast Index
       confidential information does not include information that was rightfully given to you by a
       third-party without breaching a confidentiality obligation to Podcast Index. You may
       disclose Podcast Index confidential information when compelled to do so by law if you provide us
       reasonable prior notice, unless a court orders that we not receive notice.

    violates our policies or the Terms, and we may remove or refuse to display content. Finally, content accessible

    to third parties who do not also abide by this obligation.

    Value for Value Platform if you have any concerns regarding a Value for Value Platform.

    guarantee that any errors in information it reports will be corrected.

    Index to pay any Taxes attributable to you, you agree to indemnify and reimburse Podcast Index for
    such Taxes and all costs and expenses related thereto.

6. **Scams** - Use common sense when making or receiving payments through a Value for Value Platform. Use the same
    common sense you would use in the real world when dealing with financial transactions. For more
    information about various online scams and how to avoid them, go to https://OnGuardOnline.gov.

7. **Release of Podcast Index** - Because Podcast Index is not involved in the transactions with a Value for
    Value Platform, Podcast Index is not responsible for any dispute you may have with a Value for Value
    Platform. You irrevocably release Podcast Index, its owners, managers, members, employees, agents and
    affiliates absolutely from all liability and responsibility for injury, damages, expenses, loss of
    property howsoever arising which may occur to you at any time as a result of the use of a Value for
    Value Platform. You agree to indemnify, and hold harmless, Podcast Index, its owners,

    in the Podcast Index developers console. Changes will not apply retroactively and will
    become effective no sooner than 30 days after they are posted. But changes addressing new functions
    for an API or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to
    the modified Terms for an API, you should discontinue your use of that API. Your continued
    use of the API constitutes your acceptance of the modified Terms.

    control. If you do not comply with the Terms, and Podcast Index does not take action right away,

    affect any other terms. The Terms are the entire agreement between you and Podcast Index
    relating to its subject and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements on that subject.

    State of Washington will apply in the absence of applicable federal law; and (ii) for all claims
